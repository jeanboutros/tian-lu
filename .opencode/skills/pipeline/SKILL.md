name: pipeline
description: "The agent-facing state machine for the PSC validation pipeline. Defines phases, gates, state transitions, agent routing, dispatch envelope format, and skill loading rules. All agents must follow this state machine."
---

# Pipeline State Machine

## Purpose

This skill defines the complete pipeline workflow that all agents must follow. It replaces `docs/pipeline/agents.md` as the agent-facing state machine document — agents read this skill, not the docs file, for workflow rules.

## When to Trigger

- **Always loaded** for all agents as part of the core skill set.
- **Additionally triggered** when an agent needs to determine what phase it's in, what gate to run, or how to route work.

---

## Task Domain Classification

Before dispatching Phase A, the Supreme Leader MUST classify the task scope to determine which specialists are required. The specialist roster is **task-driven**, not a fixed set of 6.

### Default Specialists (Always Required)

These specialists participate in every task regardless of domain:

- **SW Engineer** — architecture, API design, HAL interfaces
- **Test Engineer** — test strategy, coverage, edge cases
- **Docs Writer** — documentation plan, cross-document consistency

### Domain-Conditional Specialists

Additional specialists are dispatched based on task scope:

| Domain Signal | Required Specialist |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Task touches hardware, registers, GPIO, timers, peripherals | Hardware Engineer |
| Task touches wireless, RF, BLE, radio protocols, channels | Wireless Expert |
| Task touches auth, secrets, crypto, network, input parsing | Security Reviewer |
| Task touches UI, frontend, dashboard, screens, UX | **Product Designer** + **UX Engineer** |
| Task produces frontend code (HTML/CSS/JS/TSX/React/Vue/etc.) | **UI Engineer** (Phase B) |
| Task touches CI/CD, deployment, pipelines, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, infrastructure, runners, environments | DevOps Specialist |
| Task touches shell scripts, bash, POSIX sh, scripting standards, portability, script security | Bash Specialist |

### Specialist Roster Rule

The specialist count is **not** fixed at 6. It is determined by task scope:
- Minimum: 3 (SW Engineer, Test Engineer, Docs Writer)
- With hardware: +1 (HW Engineer)
- With wireless: +1 (Wireless Expert)
- With security: +1 (Security Reviewer) — automatically included if wireless or network is in scope
- With UI/UX: +3 (Product Designer, UX Engineer, UI Engineer)
- With CI/CD: +1 (DevOps Specialist)
- With shell scripting: +1 (Bash Specialist)
- Maximum: 10 (all specialists)

The Supreme Leader MUST document the specialist roster in the passport's Required Steps section before A1 dispatch. A-GATE and C-GATE criteria adapt to the actual roster — all dispatched specialists must approve.

## Phase Definitions

### Phase A — Requirements & Design

**Goal:** Define and validate "What" and "How" before writing code.

**Sub-steps:**

| Step | Name | Description | Who |
|------|------|-------------|-----|
| A0 | Task Definition | Produce detailed task specification: acceptance criteria, files, constraints, test strategy, doc plan. **Classify task domain** to determine specialist roster. | All agents collaborate |
| A1 | Parallel Specialist Review | All applicable specialists review the proposal independently, per the task-driven specialist roster | Specialist roster per Task Domain Classification |
| A2 | Dual-Model Challenge | Two model passes review architecture: primary produces, challenger critiques. Primary specialist uses their default model; challenger uses `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` via the corresponding `*-challenger` agent. | Supreme Leader orchestrates |
| A2b | Synthesis Artifact Creation | PM creates individual decision, advisory, and clarification files from A2 synthesis findings in `docs/project-management/decisions/`, `advisories/`, `clarifications/`. | PM |
| A2c | Decision Register Presentation | Supreme Leader presents complete Decision Register to user in 4 priority-ordered rounds. User rules on each finding. | Supreme Leader presents, user decides |
| A2a | ADR Creation | Every resolved design decision from A2 MUST have an ADR file created at `docs/adr/<adr-id>.md`. Use `node docs/project-management/next-id.mjs adr` to get the next ADR sequence number. | SW Engineer (writes), Docs Writer (reviews) |
| A3 | A-GATE | T3 + T-ARCH compliance check + skill coverage check | All dispatched specialists (T3), SW Engineer (T-ARCH), Skill Recruiter (skill gap) |

**A-GATE pass criteria:** All dispatched specialists issue APPROVED or CONDITIONAL PASS + T-ARCH passes + every resolved decision has an ADR file + Skill Recruiter confirms skill coverage for domain classification + all A2 synthesis artifacts created and user decisions recorded.
**A-GATE fail:** Any REJECTED → producing agent runs `post-rejection-correction` protocol first, then loop back to A1 with specific critique (max 3 loops at T3).

### A2a — ADR Creation Protocol

After the Dual-Model Challenge synthesis is complete, every resolved design decision MUST have a corresponding Architecture Decision Record.

**ADR file location:** `docs/adr/<adr-id>.md`

**ADR sequence number:** Use the provided script to get the next ADR ID:
```bash
node docs/project-management/next-id.mjs adr
```
This returns a JSON object with the next ADR ID (e.g. `"psc-adr-0001"`). Use this ID as the filename.

**Who creates ADRs:** SW Engineer writes each ADR file. Docs Writer reviews for completeness, clarity, and cross-references.

**ADR minimum structure:**
```markdown
# ADR: <Title>

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Decision:** <one-sentence summary>

## Context
What problem are we solving? What constraints exist?

## Considered Alternatives
| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| ... | ... | ... |

## Decision
What we chose and why.

## Consequences
What becomes easier, harder, or blocked by this decision.
```

**A-GATE check:** The Supreme Leader verifies that every resolved decision from the A2 synthesis has a corresponding ADR file at `docs/adr/`, and that all synthesis artifacts have been created in `docs/project-management/decisions/`, `advisories/`, and `clarifications/` with user decisions recorded. Missing ADRs → A-GATE fail with critique "missing ADR for decision <X>". Missing artifacts or unrecorded user decisions → A-GATE fail with critique "synthesis artifacts incomplete".

**User-prompted-twice signal:** If the user provides clarification or requirements during Phase A that the agent should have asked for, this is a Phase A quality failure. The agent did not apply `assumption-trap` correctly or asked an insufficient range of questions. Treat it the same as a gate rejection: run the `post-rejection-correction` protocol (maps to RC-2: Missing Question Category) before continuing. The user should never need to volunteer requirements — the agent must ask.

### Phase B — Build (PAU Loop)

**Goal:** Implement incrementally with self-validation, enforced by compliance gates.

**Sub-steps:**

| Step | Name | Description | Who |
|------|------|-------------|-----|
| B1 | PLAN | Read task, identify files, list acceptance criteria, declare logical units | Code Architect |
| B2 | APPLY (per unit) | Implement one logical unit, run build | Code Architect |
| B2a | B-UNIT-GATE | T1 + T-ARCH compliance check + skill pattern check after each unit | Code Architect (T1), SW Engineer (T-ARCH), Skill Recruiter (skill gap) |
| B3 | VALIDATE | Full build, optional flash | Code Architect |
| B3a | B-FINAL-GATE | T1 + T2 + T-ARCH compliance check + skill coverage check after all units | Code Architect (T1), SW Engineer (T2 + T-ARCH), Skill Recruiter (skill gap) |

**B-UNIT-GATE pass criteria:** All 9 T1 checks pass + T-ARCH passes + Skill Recruiter pattern check passes.
**B-FINAL-GATE pass criteria:** T1 passes + T2 passes + T-ARCH passes + Skill Recruiter comprehensive coverage check passes.
**Failure routing:** T1 → Code Architect fixes; T2 → Code Architect + Software Engineer input; T-ARCH → Software Engineer; Skill gap → Skill Recruiter flags to PM.

### Phase C — Multi-Agent Verify

**Goal:** Final check before code review. ALL dispatched specialists must approve.

**Sub-steps:**

| Step | Name | Description | Who |
|------|------|-------------|-----|
| C0 | T1 Re-run | Mechanical compliance re-check on final codebase | Code Architect |
| C1 | Dual-Model Challenge (Verification) | Primary verifier + challenger verifier. Primary uses their default model; challenger uses `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` via the corresponding `*-challenger` agent. | Supreme Leader orchestrates |
| C2 | Parallel Specialist Approval | All dispatched specialists review independently | All dispatched specialists |
| C3 | C-GATE | T1 re-run + T3 + T-ARCH + specialist finding skill check | Code Architect (T1), Dispatched specialists (T3), SW Engineer (T-ARCH), Skill Recruiter (skill gap) |
| C4 | PM Completion Review | Review all verdicts, synthesis, gate results, gap reports, correction records. Decide: CLOSE / CLOSE+NEW / BLOCK / RE-DISPATCH / CANCEL / ARCHIVE. Move ticket to appropriate status directory. | PM |

**C-GATE pass criteria:** T1 passes + all dispatched specialists APPROVED + T-ARCH passes + Skill Recruiter confirms no uncovered skill gaps from specialist findings → proceed to C4.
**C4 pass criteria:** PM issues CLOSE or CLOSE+NEW → proceed to CR phase. PM issues BLOCK → ticket moves to `blocked/`, pipeline paused. PM issues RE-DISPATCH → ticket moves to `open/`, new dispatch cycle. PM issues CANCEL → ticket moves to `closed/` (cancelled), replacement + delta analysis tickets created. PM issues ARCHIVE → ticket moves to `closed/` (archived).

### Phase CR — Code Review

**Goal:** Structured, multi-round code review of the completed implementation before commit. Each code review round produces a formal review record with detailed findings. Multiple rounds may occur until all blocking findings are resolved.

**Sub-steps:**

| Step | Name | Description | Who |
|------|------|-------------|-----|
| CR1 | Code Review Round | Reviewer produces a structured code review per the Code Review Format below. Review covers: summary, detailed assessment, findings with confidence scores, changes still pending, and verdict. | `@code-reviewer` (powered by minimax-m3) |
| CR2 | CR-GATE | All blocking findings (confidence ≥80) resolved. No open changes still pending. Reviewer verdict is APPROVED. | Supreme Leader orchestrates |
| CR3 | Review Acceptance | Author confirms all review feedback is addressed. If CR-GATE fails, loop back to CR1 for another round. | Code Architect (author) |

**CR-GATE pass criteria:** All blocking findings (confidence ≥80) from all review rounds are resolved. The "Changes Still Pending" list is empty. The reviewer's verdict is APPROVED.
**CR-GATE fail:** Any blocking finding unresolved, or changes still pending, or reviewer verdict is REJECTED → loop back to Phase B (B2) to address findings, then re-enter Phase C and CR.

#### Code Review Format

Every code review round MUST produce a review record in this format. The review record is appended to the passport's `## Code Reviews` section and written to the log directory as `CR1-review-round-<N>.md`.

```markdown
## Code Review Round <N> — <ticket-id>

### Review Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Reviewer | <agent role> |
| Date | <YYYY-MM-DD> |
| Phase | CR |
| Round | <N> |
| Files reviewed | <list of files> |
| Lines reviewed | <range or "full"> |

### Summary

<1-3 sentence overview of the changes and their quality. What was implemented? Is it correct? Any immediate concerns?>

### Detailed Assessment

<Structured analysis organized by concern area:>

#### Correctness
- <Are the changes logically correct? Do they solve the stated problem?>
- <Are edge cases handled? Error paths covered?>

#### Design & Architecture
- <Do the changes follow project architecture (HAL, typed vocabulary, module boundaries)?>
- <Are new public APIs minimally restrictive? Typed where appropriate?>

#### Code Quality
- <Is the code readable? Well-structured?>
- <Are there code smells, duplication, or unnecessary complexity?>

#### Testing
- <Are there sufficient tests for the changes?>
- <Are edge cases tested? Error paths tested?>

#### Documentation
- <Are public symbols documented?>
- <Are design decisions captured in ADRs?>

#### Security & Safety
- <Are there buffer safety concerns?>
- <Are external inputs validated?>
- <Are secrets handled correctly?>

### Findings

| ID | Confidence | Severity | File:Line | Description | Suggested Fix | Status |
|----|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| CR<N>-F1 | <score> | Critical/High/Moderate/Low | <file:line> | <description> | <fix> | Open/Resolved |
| CR<N>-F2 | <score> | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Changes Still Pending

List of changes that must be made before this review can pass. This list MUST be empty for CR-GATE to pass.

| # | Finding Ref | Description | Assigned To | Status |
|---|------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | CR<N>-F1 | <what still needs to change> | <who> | Open/In Progress/Resolved |

### Verdict

[APPROVED / CONDITIONAL PASS / REJECTED]

**Rationale:** <Why this verdict, referencing blocking findings if any>
**Blocking findings:** <list of findings with confidence ≥80, or "None">
**Advisory findings:** <list of findings with confidence <80, or "None">
```

#### Code Review Rules

1. **Every ticket MUST go through at least one code review round.** No exceptions. Even trivial changes get at least one review.
2. **Multiple rounds are expected.** If the reviewer issues REJECTED or CONDITIONAL PASS with blocking findings, the author addresses the findings and a new round begins.
3. **The "Changes Still Pending" list MUST be empty for CR-GATE to pass.** This is a hard gate — no review can pass with open changes.
4. **Findings use the review-confidence scoring system.** Every finding gets a confidence score (0-100). Findings ≥80 block.
5. **Code reviews are in addition to, not instead of, Phase C specialist reviews.** Phase C validates correctness against requirements and specs. Code review validates implementation quality, readability, and completeness.
6. **Review records are permanent.** They are appended to the passport and must not be deleted or edited after stamping.
7. **Loop back to Phase B if CR-GATE fails with code changes needed.** The author returns to B2 to implement fixes, then re-enters Phase C and CR.
8. **Maximum 5 review rounds per ticket.** After 5 rounds with unresolved blocking findings, escalate to the user.

> **All FAIL transitions require a Correction Record before retry.** For every row above where the event is a gate or check failure, the producing agent MUST complete the `post-rejection-correction` protocol and stamp a Correction Record in the passport before the Supreme Leader dispatches the retry. The Supreme Leader must verify the Correction Record is present; if it is missing, block the dispatch and route to the producing agent first.

---

## No-Hotfix-Bypass Rule

The pipeline has **no bypass, no shortcut, no fast-track**. Every change — regardless of urgency, size, or type — must go through the full pipeline: Phase A → Phase B → Phase C with gates, stamps, and specialist reviews.

### What This Means

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "It's just a quick fix" | It's a bugfix ticket. Dispatch to PM for passport creation, then Phase A. |
| "It's a one-line change" | One line still needs review, testing, and gate approval. Phase A → B → C. |
| "It's urgent / production down" | Urgency does not exempt quality. Create a `bugfix` ticket and run the pipeline. |
| "The user reported a runtime bug" | Runtime bugs are `bugfix` tickets. The pipeline catches silent failures, missing error handling, and root causes that a "quick fix" misses. |
| "I can just dispatch to code-architect directly" | No. The Supreme Leader MUST NOT dispatch directly to any producing agent for a code change. PM creates the ticket and passport first. |
| "Skipping Phase A is fine, we know what to build" | No. Phase A catches assumptions, gathers requirements, and classifies domain scope. Skipping it is how silent failures escape. |

### Why This Rule Exists

A runtime bug caused by a function that silently fails when its precondition is not met is the canonical example: a "quick fix" approach (dispatch a code agent to patch the caller) addresses the symptom but not the root cause. The pipeline exists precisely to catch:
- **RC-1 (Unverified Assumption):** Assuming a precondition is always satisfied without verifying.
- **RC-2 (Missing Question Category):** Not asking about initialization order or error handling during requirements.
- **RC-3 (Unknown Fault Pattern):** Not recognizing silent failure as a fault pattern.
- **RC-5 (Wrong Review Scope):** Reviewing only the patched function, not the broader contract.

The pipeline's gates and specialist reviews exist to catch these. Bypassing the pipeline bypasses all of them.

### Enforcement

If the Supreme Leader detects that it is about to bypass the pipeline (e.g., dispatching directly to a producing agent without a passport, skipping Phase A, or treating a bug report as a "quick fix"), it MUST:

1. **STOP** — do not dispatch.
2. **Classify the ticket type** (feature, bugfix, adhoc, etc.).
3. **Dispatch to `@pm`** with `trigger: "create-passport"` and the correct `ticket_type`.
4. **Wait** for the PM to return the ticket file and passport.
5. **Only then** proceed with pipeline routing.

### Mistake Ticket Type

When a pipeline violation is discovered after the fact (e.g., the Supreme Leader dispatched code-architect directly), the corrective action is:

1. **Halt** the current work immediately.
2. **Create a `mistake` ticket** via PM: `ticket_type: "mistake"`.
3. **Document the violation** in the mistake ticket: what was bypassed, why it happened, and the root cause.
4. **Run the `post-rejection-correction` protocol** — classify the violation (typically RC-1: Unverified Assumption that the change was "simple enough" to bypass, or RC-2: Missing Question Category about whether pipeline shortcuts are ever acceptable).
5. **Start the actual fix properly** — create a `bugfix` ticket and run the full pipeline for the underlying issue.

The `mistake` ticket type exists specifically for pipeline violations, incorrect dispatches, and process errors. It is not for code bugs — those are `bugfix` tickets.

---

## Pipeline Enforcement Protocol

The pipeline is **not advisory**. It is **mandatory**. The Supreme Leader MUST enforce these rules before every dispatch. No exceptions.

### Pre-Dispatch Gate (Non-Skippable)

Before the Supreme Leader classifies intent or routes to any agent, it MUST execute this gated sequence:

| Gate Step | Check | Failure Action |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **PM Gate** | If new task: passport must be created by PM before any routing. Supreme Leader dispatches to `@pm` with `trigger: "create-passport"` and waits. | BLOCKED — no routing until passport exists. |
| **Passport Exists** | Passport file at `docs/project-management/passports/<ticket-id>-passport.md` exists on disk. | BLOCKED — dispatch to PM for passport creation. |
| **Prior Steps Stamped** | All steps before target step have timestamps and results in Step Log. | BLOCKED — route to missing step's agent. |
| **Gate Results Recorded** | If at a gate, Gate Results table has current attempt entries. | BLOCKED — run gate first. |
| **Skips Justified** | Any unchecked Required Step has corresponding Skipped Steps entry with authorisation. | BLOCKED — require authorisation. |
| **Correction Records** | If retry_count > 0 for any tier, Correction Record exists in passport. | BLOCKED — dispatch to producing agent for post-rejection-correction. |
| **No-Bypass Check** | The dispatch is NOT routing directly to a producing agent for a code change without a passport and Phase A completion. | BLOCKED — dispatch to PM for passport creation. |

### Role Separation Rules

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Only PM creates passports | Supreme Leader MUST NOT create passport files. If none exists, dispatch to PM and wait. |
| Only PM creates tickets | Supreme Leader MUST NOT create task entries in TODO.md or ticket files. |
| Supreme Leader is dispatch-only | Supreme Leader MUST NOT perform specialist work. If a specialist fails, report to user — do not fill in. |
| No combined PM + Supreme Leader | These roles operate at different steps. The envelope must go PM → Supreme Leader, never both at once. |

### Status Protocol

When any enforcement check fails:

```
STATUS: BLOCKED
Reason: <which check failed and why>
Action Required: <what must happen to unblock>
```

The Supreme Leader must return this to the user immediately. Do NOT proceed to routing. Do NOT attempt to self-resolve.

## Dual-Model Challenge Protocol

Used in **Phase A** (architecture) and **Phase C** (verification).

### How It Works

1. **Primary pass** — First model produces the output (architecture proposal or verification). Each specialist uses their default model (see agent file for `model:` field).
2. **Challenger pass** — Second model independently reviews, using a different model. The challenger agent for each specialist uses `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2`. See the Challenger Agent Table below for mappings.
3. **Synthesis** — Supreme Leader merges findings into a synthesis document. Then dispatches to PM for artifact creation, runs the Pre-Presentation Gate, and presents the complete Decision Register to the user.

### A2 Synthesis Rules (Clarified)

The word "accepted" in A2 synthesis means **"accepted as a valid finding to present to the user"** — NOT "accepted for implementation without user review." Only the user can decide what gets implemented.

| Finding Type | Synthesis Action | Presentation to User | User Action |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Agreements** | Document in synthesis as consolidated actions | Present as consolidated action list. User may review or skip. | Review (optional) or skip |
| **Contradictions** | Document both positions with recommendation | Present each individually for explicit decision | Rule: Primary / Challenger / Neither |
| **One-sided findings** | Document with confidence and recommended action | Present priority-ordered by confidence band | Disposition: ACCEPT / REJECT / BACKLOG / DEFER / IMPLEMENT NOW |
| **Recommendations** | Document with priority | Present as priority-ordered table | Prioritize: implement now vs later |

**NO finding may be routed to Phase B without user disposition.** The Supreme Leader MUST NOT decide which findings are "accepted for implementation" — only the user can make that decision.

### A2 Decision Register Template

After every A2 synthesis, the Supreme Leader MUST produce a Decision Register in this format:

```markdown
# Decision Register — <ticket-id>

## Disagreements (N) — Primary vs Challenger Diverge
| # | Description | Primary | Challenger | Recommendation | Links |
|---|-------------|---------|------------|----------------|-------|
| D1 | <description> | <primary position> | <challenger position> | <recommendation> | [A1-<role>.md](link) |

## One-Sided Findings (N) — Challenger Only, Priority-Ordered
### Priority: CRITICAL (≥90)
| # | ID | Confidence | Description | Recommended Action | Links |
|---|----|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | M1 | 92 | <description> | <action> | [A1-<role>.md](link) |

### Priority: HIGH (80-89)
| # | ID | Confidence | Description | Recommended Action | Links |
|---|----|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|

### Priority: MODERATE (70-79)
| # | ID | Confidence | Description | Recommended Action | Links |
|---|----|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|

### Priority: LOW (<70)
| # | ID | Confidence | Description | Recommended Action | Links |
|---|----|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|

## Recommendations (N) — Challenger
| # | Recommendation | Confidence | Priority | Links |
|---|---------------|-----------|----------|-------|

## Agreements (N) — Proposed Consolidated Actions
| # | Action | Covers Agreements | Links |
|---|--------|-------------------|-------|

## Fast-Track Option
When count > 10: offer "Solve immediate, backlog rest" with rationale.

## User Decisions Required
Checklist of all items requiring user disposition.
```

### A2 Synthesis → Artifact Creation Protocol

After the A2 synthesis is complete, the Supreme Leader MUST dispatch to `@pm` with `trigger: "create-synthesis-artifacts"` to create individual files for every finding:

1. Every **CONTRADICTION** → one decision file in `docs/project-management/decisions/` (e.g., `psc-dec-0001.md`) using the flag-protocol decision format
2. Every **ONE-SIDED FINDING** with confidence ≥ 80 → one advisory file in `docs/project-management/advisories/` (e.g., `psc-adv-0001.md`)
3. Every **RECOMMENDATION** requiring user prioritization → one clarification file in `docs/project-management/clarifications/` (e.g., `psc-clar-0001.md`)

Each artifact must include:
- Link back to the source agent output
- The finding's confidence score
- The recommended action
- Status: `awaiting user decision`

After user decisions are received, the Supreme Leader dispatches to `@pm` with `trigger: "update-synthesis-artifacts"` to update each artifact's status:
- ACCEPT → status: `accepted` with implementation ticket reference
- REJECT → status: `rejected` with rationale
- BACKLOG → status: `backlog` with priority
- DEFER → status: `deferred` with re-evaluation date
- IMPLEMENT NOW → status: `implemented` with implementation ticket reference

### Challenger Agent Table

Each specialist has a corresponding challenger agent that provides the Dual-Model Challenge perspective:

| Primary Agent | Challenger Agent | Challenger Model |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| `@code-architect` | `@code-architect-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@software-engineer` | `@software-engineer-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@test-engineer` | `@test-engineer-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@docs-writer` | `@docs-writer-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@hardware-engineer` | `@hardware-engineer-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@memory-safety` | `@memory-safety-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@security-reviewer` | `@security-reviewer-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@wireless-expert` | `@wireless-expert-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@product-designer` | `@product-designer-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@ux-engineer` | `@ux-engineer-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@ui-engineer` | `@ui-engineer-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@devops-specialist` | `@devops-specialist-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| `@bash-specialist` | `@bash-specialist-challenger` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |

### Multi-Model Validation

In addition to the specialist-specific Dual-Model Challenge, the Supreme Leader and PM can invoke the `multi-model-validation` skill to launch parallel generic agents for cross-validation, fact-checking, and requirement refinement. This uses the `general-*` agents:

| Priority | Agent | Model |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | `@general-kimi` | `ollama-cloud/kimi-k2.7-code` |
| 2 | `@general-nemotron` | `ollama-cloud/nemotron-3-ultra` |
| 3 | `@general-minimax` | `ollama-cloud/minimax-m3` |
| 4 | `@general-glm` | `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` |
| 5 | `@general-deepseek` | `ollama-cloud/deepseek-v4-pro` |

Complexity tiers: Low (2 models), Medium (3), High (4), Critical (all 5). See `skills/core/multi-model-validation/SKILL.md` for the full protocol.

### When to Invoke Dual-Model Challenge

| Scenario | Use Dual-Model? |
|----------|-----------------|
| New register implementation | Yes |
| New protocol feature (whitening, CRC, etc.) | Yes |
| HAL interface change | Yes |
| Architecture change | Yes |
| Bug fix in existing code | No (single pass sufficient) |
| Documentation-only change | No |
| Trivial refactor (rename, move) | No |

## How to Read AGENTS.md and Load Domain Skills

### Tech Stack Reference

Before starting any task, read `AGENTS.md` for:
- **Multi-Agent Validation Pipeline** (Mandatory) — the 3-phase pipeline summary
- **Key Rules** — no-assumption, PAU loop, quality gate, incremental execution, flag protocol, compliance gates
- **Documentation Rules** — doc format requirements for the project
- **Design Principles** — typed vocabulary, module boundaries, structural rules
- **Domain-Specific Traps** — critical known pitfalls for the project's tech stack
- **Knowledge Management Rules** — learning doc creation requirements

### Skill Loading Rules

1. **Always loaded (core skills):** assumption-trap, compliance-gate, pipeline, pau-loop, verification-before-completion, self-audit-checklist, review-confidence, type-design-review, silent-failure
2. **Domain skills (load based on task):** any domain skills listed in AGENTS.md for the project's tech stack; datasheet-verification, memory-safety, systematic-debugging, test-driven-development as needed
3. **Phase skills (load based on phase):** brainstorming (Phase A), incremental-execution (Phase B), grill-me (Phase A or C dual-model challenge)
4. **Compliance expansion (load based on OWASP triggers):** Review task for new concern categories and load additional compliance checks as needed

### Mandatory Skill Loading Order

When a task is dispatched, skills must be loaded in this order:
1. `assumption-trap` — FIRST, always
2. `compliance-gate` — tiered checks, OWASP expansion
3. `pipeline` — this skill, state machine
4. `pau-loop` — for Phase B work
5. Domain-specific skills as needed

---

## Self-Reflection Clause

After any pipeline violation or gate failure, the responsible agent MUST ask:

1. **Why was this not caught earlier?** — What review, test, or protocol gap allowed it through?
2. **What procedural safeguard would have caught it?** — What specific check, test, or verification step would have prevented it?
3. **Update the knowledge base** — Add the lesson to the relevant skill or learning doc.

Violations in the pipeline process itself (wrong routing, missed gate, skipped step) should be logged as flags and added to the pipeline skill's lessons learned.
